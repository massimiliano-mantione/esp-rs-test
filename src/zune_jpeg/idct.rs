//! Routines for IDCT
//!
//! Essentially we provide 2 routines for IDCT, a scalar implementation and a not super optimized
//! AVX2 one, i'll talk about them here.
//!
//! There are 2 reasons why we have the avx one
//! 1. No one compiles with -C target-features=avx2 hence binaries won't probably take advantage(even
//! if it exists).
//! 2. AVX employs zero short circuit in a way the scalar code cannot employ it.
//!     - AVX does this by checking for MCU's whose 63 AC coefficients are zero and if true, it writes
//!        values directly, if false, it goes the long way of calculating.
//!     -   Although this can be trivially implemented in the scalar version, it  generates code
//!         I'm not happy width(scalar version that basically loops and that is too many branches for me)
//!         The avx one does a better job of using bitwise or's with (`_mm256_or_si256`) which is magnitudes of faster
//!         than anything I could come up with
//!
//! The AVX code also has some cool transpose_u16 instructions which look so complicated to be cool
//! (spoiler alert, i barely understand how it works, that's why I credited the owner).
